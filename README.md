Project Details
---------------
0. The project utilizes different search algorithms like A-star, DFS, Brute Force and such to find a specific goal node randomly placed in a 2d maze.
0. The game also has different pickup items like weapons, health and armor to help the player navigate safely to the goal node. These items are randomly placed around the maze.
0. Enemies are also navigating the maze to find and kill the player, the boss enemies implements the A* search algorithm to detect and destroy the player when within 60 steps of the maze’s exit goal.
0. The battle system between the enemies and the player uses the fuzzy logic API 'jFuzzyLogic.jar' found in the 'lib' folder. To improve your survivability chance make sure to keep your health and armor topped up and pick up a good weapon!. View the console output after a battle for more information.
0. I've also included the ant build file if you wish to edit and recompile the source.

To Run the Game
---------------
Run the following command to start the maze game.

```
java –cp ./mazegame.jar ie.gmit.sw.Runner
```

Note: Make sure to include both the 'fcl' & 'res' folders when running the game. Review details about fuzzy battles and search algorithms in the console output log.

How to Play
-----------
Pick a difficulty setting and press the play button to begin.

How to control the game character:

* Move Left: A
* Move Right: D
* Move Up: W
* Move Down: S
* Zoom Out Map: M
* Use Special Pick Up: K

The special pick up item displays on screen a suitable path for the player to follow. Beware, in the background the game randomly chooses a search algorithm to find the goal node in the maze. Not every search algorithm is optimized and complete so beware of wild goose chases and dead ends!

Use the zoom out function to view the behavior of the pink blocks in the maze, these guys are the boss enemies. Once you get within 60 steps of the goal node they will switch from a random walk algorithm to the A* search algorithm to hunt you down! The red blocks in the maze are common enemies. These guys will randomly walk around and fight you if you get too close! The player block is colored gold in the maze when you use the zoom out function.

Game Features & Items
---------------------
There is a number of different items placed throughout the maze, weapons, health, armor and a direction helper item. Keep an eye on your health and armor, you can only take a couple of hits from common enemies before you'll need to find some health and armor pickups. Killing a common enemy scores you 25 points, try and beat your friend’s highest score!

The direction helper item uses the A* search algorithm to compute the number of steps from the player position to the goal.

### Items
Below you'll find details about the different items implemented into the game.
#### Health
Adds 50 hp the player's stats

#### Pipe Bomb
An extremely powerful weapon against enemies with 100 battle strength

#### Helper
The helper item will display the path to the maze's exit, note that enemies can destroy the path has they walk over them!

### Game Features
Details about the different features implemented into the game.
#### Steps Counter
The game features a special step counter that display how many steps the player will need to take until the goal is reached, this re-computes every time the player moves position. The A* search algorithm is used to compute this variable.

#### Fuzzy Logic Battle
The game also features a fuzzy logic battle system that determines the outcome of fights between player and enemies in the maze. Inside of the included 'fcl' folder you'll find the rules governing the outcome of battles between two entities.

#### Smart Enemies
The game will create 'boss' enemies which will become eventually become smart and hunt you down once you get within 60 steps of the maze's exit goal. These enemies implement the A* search algorithm to compute the shortest path to find you and cut you off from the maze's exit.

### Enemy Types
Details about the different enemies implemented into the game, plus their individual strengths and weaknesses.
#### Common Enemy
The common enemy is can be easily taken down by standard weapon like the sword, better weapons will improve survivability chance from the fuzzy logic battle system. Each common enemy is running on their own independent thread and will walk randomly around the maze like dumb creatures.

Color in Maze: Red Block

#### Boss Enemy
The boss enemy will hit harder then common enemies. Note these enemies at first will be walk randomly around the maze like dumb creatures. But once you come within 60 steps of the maze's exit goal watch out, these guys will hunt you down!.
